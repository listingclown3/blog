# blog project
Hi guys, I made I custom blog website that is pretty nice!

# setup
- git clone
- setup CDN links
- change links inside server.js (that's where the config is)
- setup [giscus](https://giscus.app/) accordingly to enable commenting
- firewall/networking configurations as needed
- enjoy !

# help/support
- please join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/appb8sShtR)
- open support if it is a critical error, etc.
- all contributions would help! (i'll probably make a branch if i don't like it, no offense)
